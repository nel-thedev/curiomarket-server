# Marketplace Web App - Backend

This is the backend component of a web application built using Express, Node.js, and MongoDB. The app serves as a RESTful API for the marketplace web app frontend. It handles user authentication, store creation, item management, cart functionality, and payment processing using the Stripe API.

## Features

- User authentication: The backend provides endpoints for user registration, login, and authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- Store management: Users can create and manage their own stores. Each store has basic properties like name, description, and a list of items.
- Item management: Users can add, update, and delete items within their stores. Each item has properties such as name, picture (uploaded to Cloudinary), description, and price.
- Cart functionality: Users can add items from different stores to their cart. The cart stores the selected items for a user during their browsing session.
- Payment processing: The backend integrates with the Stripe API to handle payment processing during the checkout process.

## Technologies Used

The backend of this web app is built using the following technologies and libraries:

- Express: A fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development.
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing and retrieving data.
- Mongoose: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB.
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT): A secure method for token-based authentication.
